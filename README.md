# PTBHMTAS
*It stands for "PRESSING THE BUTTONS HARDER MAKES THE ATTACK STRONGER"*

## What is this project?

Just a silly SVG. That's it.

Oh wait, it's also my avatar sometimes.

## Usage
You have to have Helvetica Neue (Regular + Thin) installed for the SVG to be displayed properly (which basically means you need a Mac).

You can do any of these things:

1. Open it with a browser.
2. Run command `qlmanage -t -s 1000 -o . ptbhmtas.svg` (which only works on Mac) to generate `ptbhmtas.svg.png` that is 1000 pixels wide in the same directory. You can replace the `1000` with whatever number you want, obviously.
3. (Sadly this one also only works on Mac) Open `ptbhmtas.html` in Firefox or Chrome (Safari doesn't work). Right click the image and choose "Copy Image". Then open Preview, and hit `Command+N`. And voil√†! You have a PNG copy of the image.

(I can't believe I've turned an SVG file into a Mac-only thing)
